Smart Contract: smart-contract-crud

This is a simple smart contract made only for educational purpose. 

The smart contract is built upon ethereum blockchain and uses solidity as its language. The UI is built on React.js

In this smart contract, you can insert data into the blockchain and then display it on your interface.
Here, in this smart contract, contract owner can input user's full name, email id, project he is working on and time period that project will run.

In future, we'll be able to update and delete users as well. Further, ether allocation as per project duration and completion will also be added.
